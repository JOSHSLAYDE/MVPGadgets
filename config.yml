# and their alternate names in the later settings.
simpleBlacklist: true

# Which of the mobs above should be impossible to use?

# have listed in the next setting. If you want mobs listed farther down to
# be usable, be sure that they're not present in this list.

# Alternate names for creatures. List them off in the pattern shown below.
# If you want the default name for a mob to be the only option, you must
